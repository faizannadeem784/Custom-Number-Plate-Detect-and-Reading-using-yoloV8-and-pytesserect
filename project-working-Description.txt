First of all I annotate the 400 images
After that i Used yoloV8 model and done custom training
the model detect the number plate and pytesseract read the data into text format
After this the extracted data saves into a csv file with its index number 
Same type of data did not store in csv file
In overall, the model detetct the vehicles ,number plate and then extract the plate and with the use of pytesseract the data
is converted into string.
And then the extracted text get from the pytesseract saves into a csv file with its unique index number
The scv file file functions only save the uniques data the functions did not write the duplicate data again. 

[this model detect and save objects from Image, video and And it can detect the objects and save data from real time ]
